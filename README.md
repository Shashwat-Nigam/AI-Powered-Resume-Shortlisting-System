# Resume_Shortlisting_System
🎯 Goal
To build a web-based system that automatically reads, analyzes, and ranks resumes according to a company's
specific job requirements.
The system extracts details from resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn profiles, compares them against a job
description, and produces a ranked shortlist of the best-fit candidates.
It helps recruiters save time, increase accuracy, and make data-driven hiring decisions.

🌍 Real-World Use Case
Recruiters and HR teams often receive hundreds of resumes for a single job opening. Manually reading and
shortlisting them is time-consuming, inconsistent, and biased.
This system solves that by automatically:
- Reading resumes, cover letters, or LinkedIn profiles
- Matching key skills, experience, and education to the job requirement
- Scoring each candidate
- Displaying the results on a recruiter dashboard
️ Core Features
• Job Requirement Setup: Recruiters can create job listings by entering job title, department, required &
preferred skills, experiencen, education level, keywords, and description.
• Resume Upload & Extraction: Upload resumes (PDF/DOCX) and optional LinkedIn links. Extracts name,
skills, experience, education, achievements, and projects
• Dashboard & Candidate View: Displays candidate name, score, skills, experience, and includes filters for
score range, education, and years of experience.
• Download & Export: Download shortlisted candidates as Excel(CSV) or PDF, share or copy details, and export
to HR tools.
